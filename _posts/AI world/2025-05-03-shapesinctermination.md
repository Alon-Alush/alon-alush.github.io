# Explaining the Discord controversy

[Shapes.inc](https://shapes.inc/) is a platform that allows users to create and host their so-called "Shapes", which are AI-powered chatbots that are customizable and personalized.

**But here's the deal**: Their **entire Discord server**, once a hub for **10 million members!** that created, shared, and talked to these Shapes, got completely wiped by Discord in a mass-takedown campaign. Among the terminated apps **are the Shapes bots themselves** that users created through the [Developer Portal API](https://discord.com/developers/applications).


Immediately following Discord's ban of these bots, the admins quickly responded with a call to action, begging their members to submitting *mass-appeals* under the reason "`Shapes did not train AI models on discord user data and messages"`:

Allegedly, Shapes violated Discord's [Developer Terms of Service](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562894815383-Discord-Developer-Terms-of-Service) by ilegally collecting the messages that users sent to these bots.

Looking back, this "mass-appeal" campaign ended up harming their reputation even more, because, according to users, they wouldn't have denied the claims so blatanly if they truly didn't collect such data.

Discord later removed the Discord server itself, as mentioned eariler, and then, posts became flooding from users expressing their frustrations.

Others took a more balanced stance, expressing skepticism regarding Shapes's claim of "innocency" and mentioning how their questionable data collection practices have definitely played a role in the takedown:

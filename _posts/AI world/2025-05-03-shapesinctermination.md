# Explaining the Discord controversy

[Shapes.inc](https://shapes.inc/), a platform that allowed users to create and host their own AI-powered chatbots known as "Shapes", **just got mass-purged by Discord** in a ***giant mass-takedown campaign*** that completely erased *entire Discord server*, *Applications* and even *chats* users had with Shapes during this time.

Shapes, Inc had a ***massive*** Discord precense, reaching over **10 million!** members in their Discord server prior to the takedown.

After Discord started banning Shapes' Applications, the admins quickly responded with a  call to actionâ€“instructing its members to submit *mass-appeals* under the reason "`Shapes did not train AI models on discord user data and messages"`:

Looking back, this only made the situation worse; Discord later **completely erased** their Discord server totalling over 10 million members at the time.

Then, posts became flooding from users expressing their frustrations!

# PE file format: Import Address Table

An `.exe` uses the Import Address Table **to dynamically resolve the addresses where an external function's resides resides in memory**.

# Example

Here, we can see that function implementation of MessageBoxA resides in the address `0x75EA05B0` in memory.

`user32.dll` -> `MessageBoxA` -> `75EA05B0`

**How does the program *know* that MessageBoxA resides here `0x75EA05B0`?**

This is where the Import Address Table comes into play: it contains the **RVAs (Relative Virtual Addresses)** from the Image Base to the function's implementation in memory.

The program uses the Import Address Table to dynamically resolve the addresses of these functions.

# Programatically finding the IAT

Here's how to get to the IAT using WinAPI and C:
```c
IMAGE_DOS_HEADER* dosHeader = (IMAGE_DOS_HEADER*)decryptedPE;
IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64* ntHeaders = (IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64*)(decryptedPE + dosHeader->e_lfanew);
IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR* importDesc = (IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR*)((DWORD_PTR)imageBase + ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT].VirtualAddress);
IMAGE_THUNK_DATA64* firstThunk = (IMAGE_THUNK_DATA64*)((DWORD_PTR)imageBase + importDesc->FirstThunk); // Locate IAT
```

Here, firstThunk is a pointer to the Import Address Table.
# IAT structure

The IAT itself contains several fields:

![MessageBoxA implementation](/assets/images/pefileformat/fields.png)

- `u1.AddressOfData`: Before loading, this is a pointer (RVA) to an `IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME` structure (where the function name is stored)
- `u1.Ordinal` : If the function is imported by `ordinal` (number) instead of by name.
- `u1.ForwarderString`: Relative Virtual Address (RVA) that points to an ASCII string inside the PE file. This string specifies a forwarded import â€” meaning the imported function actually resides in another DLL.
